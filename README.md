# Pokemon
In this unsupervised learning study, I explored numeric video game data on Pokemon species and reduced dimensionality through principal component analysis. Additionally, I applied k-means clustering to bracket Pokemon based on all the numeric data available and, alternatively, just on their battle metrics.

pokedex_(Update_04.21).csv: This csv contains the video game Pokemon data.
